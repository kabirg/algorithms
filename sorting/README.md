Iterates through a list, and compares each element to every other unsorted one. If a new minimum is found, the two elements are swapped.

As you iterate through, the ordered section at the beginning of the list will grow as the unordered section decreases.

This is an in-place, quadratic-time sorting algorithm. Slow, but works for machines with low-memory
